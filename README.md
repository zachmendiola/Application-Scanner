# Application-Scanner
Application that accepts text, and returns the number of times a word occurs in that text above a certain threshold.

This application was born out of the career-seeking environment where I needed to know how many times a word occurs in a job posting.

To run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Extract the repository
3. Run the .exe file in the path: C:\Users\Student2\source\repos\AppScanner\AppScanner\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1

To use:
1. Copy and paste desired text into the first text box.
2. Click the load button to load the text into the program.
3. Click the go button to execute the count.
4. Click the clear button to clear the text from both fields.
